# Java launchers

Launcher scripts for some Java-based tools.

Usage:

1. Drop launcher script in respective tool dir
2. Create symbolic link to launcher script in `/user/bin` directory. E.g. assuming Epubcheck is located in directory `~/epubcheck` use the following command:

    sudo ln -s ~/epubcheck/epubcheck /usr/bin/epubcheck
